# Optimal PML Transformations

An optimal transformation for a given field and PML geometry is one which
transforms the field to have a linear variation through the PML.
This repo is a Julia implementation of this idea, which was described in a
thesis by Jonathan Deakin and submitted to the University of Manchester for a
PhD.
